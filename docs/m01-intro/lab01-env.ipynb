    "## Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up and maintaing Python environments can be painful! Python project has not been particularly good with dependency management systems. Python is easy to pick up and start coding, but it probably contributes to the messiness of the Python ecosystem. They are lots of users and usecases; for use cases where performance is vital (e.g., machine learning and scientific computing), because Python is a slow, interpreted language, people had to write performance-critical code in C/C++/Fortran and wrap them in Python. This is a good thing, but it makes dependency management even more complicated.\n",

    "\n",
    "Although learning how to set up and manage Python environments is not the most exciting thing, it is often a critical skill for a data scientist. You may be lucky enough to work with a dedicated DevOps team that takes care of this for you, or you may be in a situation where you can exclusively use cloud-based services like Google Colab, but you may also be in a situation where you have to set up your own environment, to use cutting-edge packages or due to the constraints of your organization! \n",
    "\n",
    "In such situations, it may not be how well you write code nor how well you understand your data and statistical methods, but it may well boil down to how well you can set up your environments, manage dependencies, and install critical packages. It can also help you learn how your computer and Python work under the hood. Therefore, I encourage you to learn how to set up and manage Python environments and packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, struggling to learn how to manage Python environments on top of completing the weekly assignments may be too much, especially if you are new to programming. So, while I encourage everyone to learn the basics of Python environment management, it will not be a requirement. Please do feel free to use Google Colab or other cloud-based services."

In another project, she is debugging and maintaining a legacy codebase that breaks if she uses a recent version of `numpy`. What should she do in this situation?\n",
